# ClawSignal AI — Wallet Intelligence Terminal (Static Demo)

This is a single-page, **framework-free** UI demo inspired by on-chain intelligence dashboards.

## What's inside
- Animated **Wallet Network Radar** (canvas)
- Mock **Scan Wallet** terminal + results panel
- **Token-gated premium** (demo via checkbox + localStorage)
- Auto-updating **Live Activity Feed**
- Copy-to-clipboard report

## Files
- `index.html`
- `clawsignal-styles.css`
- `clawsignal-scripts.js`

## Deploy (Vercel / Netlify)
Just upload these 3 files to the repo root and deploy as a static site.

✅ No build step needed.

## Notes
This is a UI demo only (no real chain APIs yet).
We can wire Solana/EVM RPC + indexer later.
